1. Stacks are first in last out and queues are first in first out.
2.  Linked lists have a O(n) time complexity, hash tables have a time complexity of O(1), and a binary search tree has a O(log n) time complexity.
3. Hash tables are more organized than arrays and have a faster time complexity because they are indexed. The hash table knows exactly where to go for the data.
